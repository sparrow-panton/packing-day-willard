Packing Day: Willard Asylum

An interactive contemplative website that invites visitors to ‚Äúpack‚Äù belongings for admission to Willard Asylum.

This digital artifact is a companion to my article:
Panton, Amy (2025). ‚ÄúPalimpsestic Theology: A Methodology for Engaging Psychiatric Archives in Practical Theology.‚Äù International Journal of Practical Theology. (forthcoming).

About the Project

‚ÄúPacking Day‚Äù is both experiment and ritual. Visitors choose six belongings to pack, echoing the historical practices of institutional admission at Willard Asylum. The project brings theological reflection into dialogue with psychiatric archives, memory, and embodiment.

Built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site requires no special frameworks and runs in any browser.
